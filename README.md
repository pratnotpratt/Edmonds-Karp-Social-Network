# Edmonds-Karp-Social-Network
This project demonstrates how the Edmonds–Karp algorithm (a BFS-based implementation of the Ford–Fulkerson method) can be applied to Social Network Analysis (SNA). Instead of traditional max-flow examples, we model a social network where edges represent influence strength between individuals.
